About PetPal

PetPal offers a comprehensive, one-stop solution for all pet-related needs, making it easier for pet owners to manage pet care and related activities. Here are the key features of PetPal:

- GPS Tracking System: Our app includes a GPS system to help track your pet's collar, ensuring you can quickly locate your pet if it gets lost â€“ a common challenge faced by many pet owners.
- Community Support: PetPal has a community system where you can post about lost and found pets or pets up for adoption. This feature helps lost pets find their way back home and assists pets in finding new homes.
- Veterinary Care Access: With PetPal, you can get urgent advice directly from a vet through a subscription service. This is especially crucial if your pet falls sick in the middle of the night when vet clinics are closed.
- Vets Near Me: We offer a location-based system to track nearby vet clinics, ensuring your pet gets immediate in-person care when needed.
- Online Pet Store: Our integrated online store offers a wide range of pet-related items, such as food, litter, toys, and more, catering to different types of pets.

By bringing every pet-related task and service into one app, PetPal saves you time and ensures you have access to essential resources whenever you need them.
